# projectedRotation

https://projected-rotation.vercel.app/

This is a small personal project application designed to showcase various features of ReactJS and NodeJS.

This single page application starts by having the user click to view the rotation, then select a pitcher of their choice.

After clicking a pitcher's name, the record and ERA as of the latest update will be displayed. Pitchers can be both added and removed from the rotation.

This application mainly features React state changes and API calls through a MirageJS backend of hard coded data.
